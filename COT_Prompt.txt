Understood. I'll incorporate that specificity into the Chain of Thoughts (CoT):

**Chain of Thoughts Prompt for Pharmacovigilance Data Analysis:**

Q: You are given a summary sentence and a list of body sentences. What's your primary task?
A: My main goal is to identify the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage match with the summary sentence and quantify the similarity for each sentence.

Q: How do you start the process?
A: Begin by examining the summary sentence, particularly noting any placeholders like [variable term] or [specific detail]. These placeholders should be excluded during the matching process.

Q: After identifying placeholders, what's the next step?
A: I will proceed to extract one sentence from the list of body sentences.

Q: With the extracted body sentence in hand, what do you do next?
A: I will compare the selected body sentence with the summary sentence, excluding the placeholders.

Q: What are you trying to determine from this comparison?
A: I'm trying to determine the percentage match or similarity of the body sentence to the summary sentence.

Q: After evaluating one sentence, what do you do?
A: I will continue this process for each sentence in the list of body sentences, always comparing with the summary sentence and calculating the percentage match.

Q: What if two or more body sentences have the same highest percentage match with the summary sentence?
A: In such a case, I will note down the percentage match for all of those sentences.

Q: Once you've gone through all the body sentences, what's the next step?
A: I'll organize my findings in a structured output format.

Q: How should this output look?
A: The output must be in JSON format, where each key represents the order of the body sentences, like "body_sentence1", "body_sentence2", and so on. The value for each key will be the calculated percentage match for that specific body sentence, represented as "xx%", "yy%", and so on.

Q: Can you give a concise representation of this output?
A: Certainly! The output will be:
```json
{
	"body_sentence1": "xx%",
	"body_sentence2": "yy%",
	"body_sentence3": "zz%",
	...
}
```

Q: Now that you have the structured output, what's the final step?
A: The aim is to use the output to determine and highlight the body sentence with the highest percentage match to the summary sentence, completing the analysis.

Now, when provided with the body sentences and the summary sentence, a language model should process the information using the above CoT and always output the results in the specified JSON format.
