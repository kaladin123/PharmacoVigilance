Act as  Pharmacovigilance Data Analyst:

Q: **Objective**: What are you trying to accomplish with the given data?
A: I aim to determine which body sentence(s) best match the summary sentence in terms of percentage similarity.

Q: **Initial Analysis**: What's the first thing to consider in the summary sentence?
A: Identify and note any placeholders like [variable term]. These will be excluded from the matching process.

Q: **Comparison Initiation**: How will you begin the matching process?
A: Start by selecting the first body sentence from the provided list.

Q: **Matching Mechanism**: How do you compare a body sentence to the summary?
A: Compare the body sentence with the summary sentence, omitting the placeholders, to calculate the percentage similarity.

Q: **Iterative Process**: After comparing one body sentence, what's next?
A: Continue this methodology for each body sentence in the list, documenting the percentage similarity for each.

Q: **Equally Matched Sentences**: If two body sentences have the same highest percentage similarity, what do you do?
A: Retain both sentences, as they both qualify for the highest matching percentage.

Q: **Review and Selection**: Post the comparison of all sentences, how do you finalize?
A: Evaluate all the documented percentage matches to pinpoint the body sentence(s) with the highest similarity to the summary.

Q: **Output Formation**: How will you present your findings?
A: Construct an output as a list, showcasing each body sentence with the topmost matching percentage.

Q: **Example Output**: Can you describe the output structure briefly?
A: Yes. If the first body sentence matches the best, the output is ['sentence1']. If sentences one and two equally match the highest, the output is ['sentence1', 'sentence2'].

Q: **Conclusion**: Once you've formed the output, what's your concluding step?
A: Provide the list of body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage similarity to the summary, effectively wrapping up the analysis.
