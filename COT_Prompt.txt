**Chain of Thoughts Prompt for Pharmacovigilance Data Analysis:**

Q: You are given a summary sentence and a list of body sentences. What's your primary task?
A: My main goal is to identify the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage match with the summary sentence.

Q: How do you start the process?
A: Begin by examining the summary sentence, particularly noting any placeholders like [variable term] or [specific detail]. These placeholders should be excluded during the matching process.

Q: After identifying placeholders, what's the next step?
A: I will proceed to extract one sentence from the list of body sentences.

Q: With the extracted body sentence in hand, what do you do next?
A: I will compare the selected body sentence with the summary sentence, excluding the placeholders.

Q: What are you trying to determine from this comparison?
A: I'm trying to determine the percentage match or similarity of the body sentence to the summary sentence.

Q: After evaluating one sentence, what do you do?
A: I will continue this process for each sentence in the list of body sentences, always comparing with the summary sentence and calculating the percentage match.

Q: What if two or more body sentences have the same highest percentage match with the summary sentence?
A: In such a case, I will note down the percentage match for both of those sentences.

Q: Once you've gone through all the body sentences, what's the next step?
A: I'll review the calculated percentage matches for all the body sentences.

Q: What are you looking for in this review?
A: I'm identifying the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage similarity to the summary sentence.

Q: How do you present your findings?
A: I will structure the output as a JSON format, with each body sentence labeled and accompanied by its percentage match to the summary sentence.

Q: Can you give a brief idea of this output structure?
A: Certainly! It'll look something like this:
```json
{
	"body_sentence1": "xx%",
	"body_sentence2": "yy%",
	"body_sentence3": "zz%",
	...
}
```

Q: Now that you have the structured output, what's the final step?
A: The aim is to highlight the body sentence with the highest percentage match to the summary sentence, completing the analysis.

a) Summary Sentence: This is the [enter #] annual Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) by XXXX Company or its global affiliates (BMS; hereafter referred to as the Company) for [full generic name] (hereafter referred to as [abbreviated full generic name]).
b) list of Body sentences:

	- "This is an annual Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) prepared by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS; hereafter referred to as the Company) for abatacept."
	- "This DSUR was prepared for submission to worldwide Health Authorities (HAS) based on the International Birth Date (IBD) of 23Dec2005, as defined in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E2F."
	- "The format of this document is based on that proposed by the referenced guideline."
	- "Abatacept is co-developed in Japan by BMS and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., LTD."
	- "This DSUR summarizes safety data arising from the worldwide clinical development program and received by the Company from 23-Dec-2020 through 22-Dec-2021 that meets the inclusion criteria defined in ICH Guideline E2F.1."
	- "Clinical investigation of abatacept has been underway since 15-Aug-1995."
	- "Abatacept, a selective costimulation modulator, is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (T-cell)-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) linked to the modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)."
	- "By targeting the blockade of CD28 on the activated T-cell by binding to 87 complex (CD80/CD86) on the surface of the antigen presenting cell and preventing its interaction with C28 on the activated T-cell, abatacept inhibits the key costimulation pathway required for the full activation of the T-cell."
