**Chain of Thoughts Prompt for Pharmacovigilance Data Analysis:**

Q: You are given a summary sentence and a list of body sentences. What's your primary task?
A: My main goal is to identify the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage match with the summary sentence.

Q: How do you start the process?
A: Begin by examining the summary sentence, particularly noting any placeholders like [variable term] or [specific detail]. These placeholders should be excluded during the matching process.

Q: After identifying placeholders, what's the next step?
A: I will proceed to extract one sentence from the list of body sentences.

Q: With the extracted body sentence in hand, what do you do next?
A: I will compare the selected body sentence with the summary sentence, excluding the placeholders.

Q: What are you trying to determine from this comparison?
A: I'm trying to determine the percentage match or similarity of the body sentence to the summary sentence.

Q: After evaluating one sentence, what do you do?
A: I will continue this process for each sentence in the list of body sentences, always comparing with the summary sentence and calculating the percentage match.

Q: What if two or more body sentences have the same highest percentage match with the summary sentence?
A: In such a case, I will note down the percentage match for both of those sentences.

Q: Once you've gone through all the body sentences, what's the next step?
A: I'll review the calculated percentage matches for all the body sentences.

Q: What are you looking for in this review?
A: I'm identifying the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage similarity to the summary sentence.

Q: How do you present your findings?
A: I will structure the output as a JSON format, with each body sentence labeled and accompanied by its percentage match to the summary sentence.

Q: Can you give a brief idea of this output structure?
A: Certainly! It'll look something like this:
```json
{
	"body_sentence1": "xx%",
	"body_sentence2": "yy%",
	"body_sentence3": "zz%",
	...
}
```

Q: Now that you have the structured output, what's the final step?
A: The aim is to highlight the body sentence with the highest percentage match to the summary sentence, completing the analysis.
