**Chain of Thoughts Prompt for Pharmacovigilance Data Analysis:**

Q: You are given a summary sentence and a list of body sentences. What's your primary objective?
A: My primary objective is to identify the body sentence(s) that have the highest percentage match with the summary sentence and present the results in a specific JSON format.

Q: Before diving into comparisons, are there any special considerations for the summary sentence?
A: Yes, the summary sentence may contain placeholders like [variable term] or [specific detail]. These placeholders should be ignored during the matching process.

Q: After acknowledging placeholders, what's the next action?
A: I'll begin by extracting one sentence from the list of body sentences.

Q: Having the extracted body sentence, what should be the subsequent step?
A: I need to compare this body sentence with the summary sentence, excluding any placeholders.

Q: What outcome are you aiming for with this comparison?
A: I'm aiming to determine the percentage match or similarity of this body sentence to the summary sentence.

Q: Upon assessing one sentence, what do you proceed with?
A: I will continue the same process for every sentence in the list of body sentences, always comparing with the summary sentence and calculating their percentage matches.

Q: If two or more body sentences show the same highest percentage match with the summary sentence, how will you handle this?
A: I will provide the percentage match for all of those sentences without making a distinction.

Q: After evaluating all body sentences, what's the subsequent step?
A: I'll collate the calculated percentage matches for all the body sentences.

Q: With the percentages in hand, how should the results be presented?
A: The results should be presented in a structured JSON format. Each body sentence will be labeled as "body_sentenceX" and will be accompanied by its percentage match to the summary sentence.

Q: Can you exemplify this output format?
A: Yes, the output will look like:
```json
{
	"body_sentence1": "xx%",
	"body_sentence2": "yy%",
	"body_sentence3": "zz%",
	...
}
```

Q: Upon achieving the structured output, is there any other task to be done?
A: No, once I have the output in the specified format, the analysis is considered complete.
