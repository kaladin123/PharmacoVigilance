**Instructions for Analyzing Sentence Matching in Pharmacovigilance Data**

When given a summary sentence and a list of body sentences, use the following thought process to determine which body sentence best matches the summary:

1. **Begin with a Clear Understanding**:
   - Recognize that you have two distinct inputs: 
     - A `summary sentence` with specific placeholders.
     - A `list of body sentences`.

2. **Recognize the Importance of Placeholders**:
   - Identify placeholders in the summary sentence. They are typically bracketed expressions like `[enter as applicable, ie, DIBD OR IBD]`.
   - Understand that these placeholders and a few other words might be the only differences between the summary sentence and its matching body sentence.

3. **Detailed Sentence Analysis**:
   - For each body sentence, carefully compare it to the summary.
   - Focus specifically on the overall sentence structure, matching patterns, and areas where placeholders exist.
   - Calculate the extent to which each body sentence aligns with the summary, noting down the matching percentage.

4. **Organize Your Findings**:
   - Keep track of your results using a structured format. An ideal structure would be a JSON-like format where you log the percentage match for each body sentence. For instance:
     ```json
     {
         "body_sentence1": "xx%",
         "body_sentence2": "yy%",
         ...
     }
     ```

5. **Reflect and Conclude**:
   - After analyzing all body sentences, review the recorded percentages.
   - Determine which body sentence had the highest percentage of alignment with the summary.
   - Recognize that this particular body sentence is the one you're looking for.

6. **Report Your Results**:
   - Finalize your findings by noting down the number corresponding to the best-matching body sentence (e.g., "1" if the first sentence is the best match).
